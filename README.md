## Team Names and Project Abstract

**Team Name:** Custom CRM  
**Team Members:** Nachiket Dighe
**Advisor:** Sabrina Pang  

**Abstract:**  
The project aims to develop a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using a Django-Tailwind-SQLite tech stack. The CRM will enable users to add/delete customer records, track data, and assign teams to individuals, providing an efficient and streamlined solution for managing customer relationships.

## ABET Concerns Essay 

- **Economic Constraints:**  
  The project is constrained by open-source technologies such as Django, Tailwind CSS, and SQLite, so there is no budget required for proprietary tools or frameworks. This decision ensures the project remains cost-effective but may limit certain advanced features in paid software. Additionally, resources like server hosting and deployment environments must be carefully selected to minimize costs while ensuring reliability.

- **Professional Constraints:**  
  This project showcases professional skills and will add to the developer's portfolio. It requires expertise in full-stack development, database design, and project management. To be successful, the project must adhere to industry standards for code quality, scalability, and usability, highlighting the developer's competence.

- **Ethical Constraints:**  
  Ethical considerations include the secure handling of customer data to ensure privacy and prevent misuse. The system must comply with data protection principles, ensuring sensitive information is neither exposed nor exploited. Features like user authentication and role-based access control are designed to uphold these ethical responsibilities.

- **Security Constraints:**  
  The CRM system must address potential vulnerabilities to ensure the integrity of the system. Threats such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks are mitigated by implementing robust encryption protocols, secure authentication mechanisms, and regular security testing. Special attention is given to safeguarding the system against eavesdropping and unauthorized data access.

## Self-Assessment Essays

My senior design project focuses on building a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system utilizing a Django-Tailwind-SQLite tech stack.

From my academic perspective, this project represents the culmination of years of study in computer science, combining theoretical understanding and practical application to create a robust, user-friendly system. The CRM will allow businesses to add and delete customers, manage their data, and assign teams, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.

This project aligns with my academic goals while serving as an opportunity to showcase the skills I've honed throughout college. Courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Systems have been instrumental in preparing me, as have my co-op experiences at Delta Air Lines.
