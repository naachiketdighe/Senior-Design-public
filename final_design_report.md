# Final Design Report for Custom CRM System

## 1. Project Description
**Abstract (400 characters):**  
The Custom CRM System is a full-stack web application built using Django, TailwindCSS, and SQLite. It enables small-to-medium businesses to manage customer data, assign teams, track interactions, and generate reports. Designed with a responsive UI and role-based access, it prioritizes usability, scalability, and data security.

The final version includes modules for customer CRUD operations, team assignments, secure authentication, and a reporting dashboard. Development followed agile methodology with iterative testing, frequent commits, and user-centered design principles.

## 2. User Interface Specification (Optional)
Screenshots are included in the GitHub repository and presentation slides. Key UI features:
- Responsive customer table and form layout
- Team assignment dropdown
- Secure login/logout screens
- Interactive report charts

## 3. Test Plan and Results
**Tests executed:**
- **10 functional test cases** covering login, CRUD, assignments, and access control
- **2 boundary tests** for form limits
- **3 abnormal/security tests** for access and error conditions
- **Performance test** with 10,000+ records

**Results:**
All normal cases passed. Boundary conditions validated form behavior. Unauthorized access was blocked. System handled large datasets efficiently. Detailed matrix and case descriptions are available in the Test Plan document.
