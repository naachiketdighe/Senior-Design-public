# Senior Design Project: Custom CRM Development

My senior design project focuses on building a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system utilizing a Django-Tailwind-SQLite tech stack.

From my academic perspective, this project represents the culmination of years of study in computer science, combining theoretical understanding and practical application to create a robust, user-friendly system. The CRM will allow businesses to add and delete customers, manage their data, and assign teams, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.

This project not only aligns with my academic goals but also serves as an opportunity to showcase the skills I’ve honed throughout my college experience while addressing real-world needs.

## Academic Preparation

My college curriculum has been instrumental in preparing me for this project. Courses such as **Data Structures and Algorithms** gave me a foundational understanding of algorithms and problem-solving. At the same time, **Database Design** and **Python Programming** taught me efficient ways to organize and retrieve data in Python and SQL. Advanced courses like **Software Engineering** emphasized project management methodologies. These courses not only developed my technical expertise but also fostered essential skills like teamwork, communication, and critical thinking.

## Real-World Experience

Beyond the classroom, my co-op experiences have provided invaluable real-world context. At **Delta Air Lines**, I developed an internal-use website using Flask, a framework similar to Django. This project involved creating dynamic web applications, integrating backend services, and ensuring seamless user interactions, which deepened my understanding of web frameworks and their practical applications. Additionally, my role as a data analyst for the **Bearcat Buddies** department taught me how to optimize workflows and manage teams. These roles also improved my non-technical skills, such as project planning, adaptability, and client communication, all of which will contribute to the successful execution of this project.

## Motivation and Preliminary Approach

My motivation for this project stems from a passion for creating practical solutions that address real-world challenges. The prospect of building a system that can simplify business operations and improve efficiency excites me, as it combines my technical abilities with a meaningful purpose. Moreover, the project aligns with my long-term goal of becoming a versatile software engineer capable of tackling complex problems.

My preliminary approach involves breaking the project into manageable phases: requirements gathering, database schema design, backend development with Django, frontend styling with Tailwind, and iterative testing. This systematic approach will ensure a well-structured and efficient development process.

## Expected Results and Evaluation

I expect the project to yield a fully functional CRM system tailored to small-to-medium-sized businesses. The system’s success will be measured by its usability, reliability, and scalability. To evaluate my contributions, I will establish clear benchmarks and conduct regular self-assessments, focusing on code quality, feature completeness, and adherence to timelines. Peer feedback and user testing will further validate the system’s effectiveness. Ultimately, I’ll consider the project a success if it meets the defined requirements and demonstrates a tangible impact on business operations. Through this effort, I aim to not only deliver a high-quality product but also refine my skills as an independent and innovative problem-solver.
